###Questions and Assumptions

**2. What does the board look like?**

Our board is a rectangle

**3. How do we know two pieces fit together?**

The curvature of the indentation on one piece will match up to the curvature of the extrusion on another.

**4. Can one piece fit with multiple pieces? **

No, the matches will be unique - one piece will only fit with one other piece.
