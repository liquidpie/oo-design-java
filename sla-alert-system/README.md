Design a SLA monitoring system for different jobs and alert when SLA is breached

Every job has an SLA defined

Users can pick a job or auto-assigned. They have the option to start the job, pause the job and finish the job with given SLA.
If the job takes more time than the defined SLA, user should be notified and their manager should be notified too based on certain criteria

There are admins who can assign roles and permissions to the users and define SLA for different roletype and jobtype.
They can fine tune SLA if needed.

The system should automatically monitor SLA at different times and alert based on the requirement (urgency and priority).
