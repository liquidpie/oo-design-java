# vaccine-scheduler

Our goal is to implement and demonstrate a service for connecting vaccine patients with providers. Patients should be able to browse available appointments, make or cancel a reservation, and review the details of their reservation. Providers need to manage their available appointments and review their daily appointment reservations.

Patients may only have one reservation in total at any given time (not one per provider).

All vaccination appointments last 30 minutes and start on the hour or half hour. Providers may otherwise create appointments at any time of day.

The desired API is provided, and may be adapted to your preferred programming language.
