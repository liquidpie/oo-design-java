# online-book-reader

Design an online book reader system 

Let’s assume we want to design a basic online reading system which provides the following functionality:

* Searching the database of books and reading a book.
* User membership creation and extension.
* Only one active user at a time and only one active book by this user


### Implementation

We’ve chosen to break down components into Library, UserManager, and Display classes.

The classes:

1. User
2. Book
3. Library
4. UserManager
5. Display
6. OnlineReaderSystem
